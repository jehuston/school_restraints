Test out your code in an interactive python session (ipython or notebook).
Once you have code that answers the question, paste it in a .py file. When you're
done, see if you can make your code DRY but writing a couple functions.

# What state has most reports? Thoughts?

# Let's look at California. What district has most reports? What school has the
# highest rate of physical restraints? Of mechanical restraints? (hint: sum
# across both types of students. What else do you need to calculate a rate?)

# Look at data definitions tab in excel file. Let's compare the different types
# of restraints (mechanical v. physical) for disabled and non-disabled students.

# Look at the Propublica_dirty column. How many schools had "dirty" data?
# Do the answers to the above look any different if we exclude these schools?

# The ProPublica article says Montgomery County Public Schools have taken action
# on this issue. How can we filter the dataframe down to see schools in this district?
# Hint: look up pandas Series string contains() method.

# Bonus: try creating visualization of the different types of restraints used against
# disable/non-disabled students (as above). How might you design this data viz?
