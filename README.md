# Practicing Pandas with School Restraints Data from ProPublica

Familiarize yourself with Pandas by exploring a freely available dataset from ProPublica about use of physical and mechanical restraints in schools.
* Download the data set from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/restraint-and-seclusion-data)
* Answer the questions in the exercise.py file
* Store your code in either that file or another .py file, and try to make DRY code :) 
* Create an Images folder and store any visualizations you create there.
* What other interesting questions can you answer with this dataset?
